This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The `BuggyArray.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds. The `CorrectedArray.java` file provides the corrected version.  This is a subtle but frequently encountered error in programming.
